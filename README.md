This was the first app we made in Node.JS. I used the bandsintown API, the Spotify API,  and  the IMBD API to make an app that allows you to search for artists, songs, and movies.  
IF you type in node concert-this and your artist name into the node app it will give you a list of upcoming concerts for the artist. If you type in node spotify-this-song and thena  song name it will search through spotify for the song and give back information on the song.
If you type in node movie-this and your movie title it will give you information on the movie. Make sure to run an NPM install and happy searching.
